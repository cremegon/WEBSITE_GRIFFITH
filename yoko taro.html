					<p> "When I create video games and write stories, my goal is not the quality of the substance inside the product, but rather it is the response within the player's brain that I'm trying to reach." <br><br>

					Taro began his career as a 3D modeler for game titles at Cavia, until his debut as a director came from his proposal of the new IP "Drakengard", where he assumed full creative control as director, upon which the game succeeded as a cult classic title. <br><br>

					"I felt like expanding a title I already finished, felt like a failure to me. I did not want to repeat the order of things for the profit, I wanted to experiment with something else and create new experiences." <br><br>

					Taro stepped down from his directory role in Drakengard 2 and permitted another member to take responsibility, as he saw the first game as a self-contained completed universe. <br><br>

					However, in 2010 and onwards, Taro returned with Newer titles as "NieR" and "NieR; Automata" and also Drakengard 3, which in an interview with Square Enix, refused to do an in-person commentary and instead carried out the entire video as a sock puppet, asking players "Not to play the game" as he fully knew the bugs in the game engine but assured them that if they were patient with him, then they would recieve a genuine experience. <br><br>

					"I don't think I'm so special, I do what I like and I do what I do. I think the people working here (Platinum Games) are all far better than me and I am honored that they listen to my outlandish ideas." <br><br>

					One of Taro's greatest praise is recieved from his direction of his game's soundtrack. Taro claims that one of the greatest things that ever happened to him was when he met Emi Evans and Keichii Okabe, the Vocalist and Artist for all of Taro's hit titles. <br><br>

					"I wanted to create a music that transcended difference in our cultural world, so I created a dummy 'Chaos' language as a mash of all of the sounds of world languages and asked (Emi Evans) to sing it. I didn't know what to expect, maybe she'd think I'm too weird and never work with me again. But she trusted me and sung the songs. Okabe-san is a true genius, his musical scoring and Emi-san's voice truly brought the series to life and I am so dearly thankful to both of them today." <br><br>

					When asked for the inspiration behind his stories or the connection between them, Taro refuses an explanation as he admits even he doesn't know what he write in the middle of his stories before the climax. His aim is not to restrict the player to what it is, but instead it is an impression of "What he thinks". <br><br>

					In an interview about his NieR and Automata story/ending, he informs that the vision came from his impression of the events after 9/11. The War on Terror was a slaughter from the righteous claiming to be righteous, influencing the discourse of it's identity and it's people as the heroes, without ever understanding the other side, and the plight they undergo because of the oblivion of the victor. <br> <br>

					On the ending of Automata, Taro says it came from "A Coca Cola commercial" he saw. On May of 2013, Coca Cola launched a "Small Worlds" project that put a special vending machine in Pakistan and India, two countries that have eternal rivalries and political animosity between one another. The goal of the machine was to work together with a person from the other side of the screen on a screen game and share a Coke together. When he saw this, Taro saw the glimpse of his final story and ending to NieR; Automata and began developing the game's story based entirely on the impression of "togetherness" he felt from the video. <br><br>

					Taro assures that he will continue to write and create more stories for people to experience, but guarantees no date, as he himself does not when the epiphany will hit him and until it does, he will continue to do what he does in his daily life and hobby.
